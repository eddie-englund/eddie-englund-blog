# What's this folder about and was it commited by mistake?

This folder creates settings and other stuff for vscode.

The settings.json specifically forces the workspace to use certain settings which is good since then we won't have to remind users to set those settings for this project!

As for the `extentions.json` this will prompt the user on launch of the project if if the listed recommended extentions are not installed on the machine.
